#### _D-Talk_


## Overview

If you want to grow as a developer, we can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a developer community. There are many advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing support, sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions, and much more. D-Talk helps us solve this problem efficiently using various chat rooms.

### üî∂ Intro

D-talk is basically a domain - specific talk platform that helps users get solution for domain - specific doubts exclusively for developers / programmers. Accommodation Platform involving username & Domain Section to help user redirect to respective Domain Chat Room. In Every Chat Room , you'll get moderator ( Domain Expert ) , who'll take care of any of your queries and will be assigned to solve Domain - Specific Doubts. 


### üî∂ Why We Made This Platform 

The Foundation of this Platform holds one basic Principle and that is to help developers / programmers by giving them access to Specific Domain Private Chat Rooms. Chat Rooms to help them overcome obstacles of their programming journey no matter they're on any ( beginner , intermediate or advanced ) level.

Web Developers / Programmers Come up with Numerous Problems Daily , Not even Big platforms like Discord , Twitter etc helps in providing solution efficiently because they lack Specific Domain Division , that's why we're developing D-Talk so, that people can avoid those things and get on with personalised Domain Chat Rooms and Get their doubts solved without facing fear of getting avoid by crowd or nitwit doubts.


### üî∂ How This Platform is HelpFul 

 This Web App is available for everyone. In general, people face problems like getting their doubt ignored/missed in-crowd, Fear of not asking Silly doubts cause of big platform, etc but by giving them access to Particular Domain Chat Rooms and Handler to help them in their doubts, we can reduce their problems to a minimum and will lead to maintaining healthy community Forward. In Addition, they'll acquire a fully anonymous identity to keep their privacy intact. 


### üî∂ Vision For The Future 

üçÄ Following are development plans we're gonna implement in Future ; 

üî∑ Add Moderators Account 

üî∑ Integrating more advanced chat options ( addition of allowing users to share Code Snippets & Links as it is ) 

üî∑ Giving Moderators More Accessibility Permissions.


#### Technology used

To handle multiple threads over various chat rooms, we needed a substantial multi-purpose language i.e. Vanilla JavaScript on the frontend with a custom UI, WebSockets using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io  (Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It consists of: a Node. js server: Source | API. )

We have also used NPM (Node Packet Manager) which greatly helped us with our Node development.
